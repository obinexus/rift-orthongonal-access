## 🧠 What is RIFT?

RIFT stands for **Right-angle Interdimensional Frame Transition** — a theory and algorithmic framework for stable, coherent traversal between dimensional planes using orthogonal access instead of space-time warping.

## 📘 Key Concepts

- **Orthogonal Access:** Traverse dimensions by moving at 90° from known space-time threads.
- **Thread Pinning (gosi.pin):** Bind semantic intent to deterministic computational threads.
- **Quantum Entangled Anchors:** Preserve causality across dimensional transitions.
- **Dimensional Game Theory:** Use strategy vectors to model universe traversal and business logic.
